      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost seven years ago I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new and unexpected journey. Back then&#xA;I had some experience with test automation in Python and Java and I&amp;rsquo;ve joined&#xA;the team working on the backend application written in Scala. It was my first&#xA;experience with functional programming so I was wondering if&#xA;it would not be hard to learn and maintain the test suite written in this&#xA;new for me language. It turned out that it&amp;rsquo;s not and the work with Scala&#xA;gave me a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this first episode of the blog post series I would like to show how&#xA;to start testing a REST API using ScalaTest and how to use some more&#xA;advanced features of this one of the most popular Scala-based test frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
